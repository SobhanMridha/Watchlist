# üé¨ Watchlist - Movie Watchlist & Watched Tracker

**Watchlist** is a Flask web application that empowers users to discover new movies, create a personalized watchlist, and track what they‚Äôve already watched. Leveraging the TMDb API, it displays real-time movie data‚Äîposters, ratings, genres, release dates‚Äîand provides a responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS. This README documents every component of the project, explains the rationale behind key design choices, and guides you through setup, usage, and deployment.

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ login.html / register.html
```

**app.py**  
This is the heart of the application. It defines all Flask routes and business logic:  
- `/` handles search, category filtering (popular, top_rated, now_playing, upcoming), and renders the homepage.  
- `/watchlist` and `/watched` (POST) insert movie IDs into the SQLite tables.  
- `/remove` and `/move` manage deletion and migration between watchlist and watched lists.  
- Database setup uses `get_db()` for SQLite3 connections and enforces unique constraints on `(user_id, movie_id)`.

**database.db**  
A SQLite database storing two tables‚Äî`watchlist` and `watched`‚Äîalongside a `users` table . Unique constraints on `(user_id, movie_id)` prevent duplicates.

**genres.json**  
A static JSON mapping TMDb genre IDs to names. We chose this to avoid repeated API calls for genre lists, speeding up template rendering and limiting TMDb rate usage.

**requirements.txt**  
Contains all Python dependencies, including `Flask`, `gunicorn`, `requests`, and `itsdangerous`. Keep this updated via `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

**Procfile**  
Used by Render for deployment:
```
web: gunicorn app:app
```
Specifies that `gunicorn` should serve the `app` object from `app.py`.

**.gitignore**  
Excludes `__pycache__/`, environment files, and any local secrets. Note: we do **not** ignore `database.db` for the demo, so initial data ships with the repo.

**static/**  
- **css/**: Custom CSS overrides (if any) alongside Tailwind defaults.  
- **images/**: Hero background and any locally stored assets.

**templates/**  
- **layout.html**: Base template defining head, navigation, and flash message blocks. Includes Tailwind imports.  
- **index.html**: Extends `layout.html`, defines the hero section, search/category bar, and main content area. It also includes the movie grid and handles search and filter functionality (via form submissions).

- **watched.html**: Renders a grid similar to the homepage but for movies fetched by ID from the `watched` table.  
- **watchlist.html**: Renders a grid similar to the homepage but for movies fetched by ID from the `watchlist` table.
- **login.html / register.html**: For user authentication.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/watchlist.git
   cd watchlist
   ```

2. **Create & activate a virtual environment**  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Obtain TMDb API key**  
   - Sign up at [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org).  
   - In `app.py`, set:  
     ```python
     API_KEY = "your_tmdb_api_key"
     app.secret_key = "a_random_secret_key"
     ```  
   - Or export as environment variables.

5. **Initialize the database**  
   If you wish to start fresh or migrate:  
   ```bash
   flask shell
   >>> from app import init_db
   >>> init_db()  # creates tables
   ```

6. **Run Locally**  
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```  
   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## üöÄ Deployment to Render

1. **Push to GitHub**, linking your repo to Render.  
2. **Create New Web Service** on Render.com:  
   - Environment: Python 3  
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
   - Start Command: `gunicorn app:app`  
3. **Ensure** `database.db` is tracked if you want initial data. For real-world apps, switch to PostgreSQL via Render‚Äôs managed databases.
